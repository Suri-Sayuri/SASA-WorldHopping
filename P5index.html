        <p><span> Do you know Spain has a very unique history?</span></p><br><br>
        <p>At different moments in time, the land of present-day Spain has been sought after by the greatest empires: the Carthaginians and the Romans fought over it, the Arabs conquered it, and the Catholic Monarchs recovered it and made it into the most powerful empire in the world with the Spanish conquest of America. In fact, under King Philip II of Spain there was no time in which the sun was not shining on one part of Spain’s territory, which stretched from the Philippines (guess which king they were named after!) to the Americas with Spain, Portugal, Flanders, Italy, and parts of what is now Germany in between.
        However, the reign of Phillip II also marked the beginning of an era of economic and political decline, with wars both domestic and foreign. The American territories won independence over the course of the 1800s, culminating with Spain losing control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines just before the turn of the 20th century. These events have shaped a large part of the modern world into what it is today.

        <p><span> La Alhambra - a special Islamic Building last till now</span></p><br><br>
        <p>Alhambra, palace and fortress of the Moorish monarchs of Granada, Spain. The name Alhambra, signifying in Arabic “the red,” is probably derived from the reddish colour of the tapia (rammed earth) of which the outer walls were built.
        Constructed on a plateau that overlooks the city of Granada, the Alhambra was built chiefly between 1238 and 1358, in the reigns of Ibn al-Aḥmar, founder of the Naṣrid dynasty, and his successors. The splendid decorations of the interior are ascribed to Yūsuf I (died 1354). After the expulsion of the Moors in 1492, much of the interior was effaced and the furniture was ruined or removed. Charles V, who ruled in Spain as Charles I (1516–56), rebuilt portions in the Renaissance style and destroyed part of the Alhambra in order to build an Italianate palace designed by Pedro Machuca in 1526.
